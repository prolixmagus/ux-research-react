                    <h2>Strategic UX Research sets the business’ direction, determines where to invest, and focuses the entire organization’s long-term and short-term objectives on prioritizing improved experiences.
                    </h2>

                    <p>Join our online workshop to make UX a valuable part of the organization’s strategy. During each of this course’s four weeks, you’ll cover two of the eight Strategic UX Research topics. For each topic, you’ll watch a pre-recorded lecture and join Jared in a live small-group coaching session.
                    </p>
                    <p>The lectures are already recorded, so you can watch them in advance or join an optional “Live Watch” session with your fellow cohort members.
                    </p>
                    <p>In each coaching session, you’ll work directly with Jared and your fellow cohort members to create a strategic UX Research plan and work through challenges that are specific to your current situation. You’ll hear how others are working through their challenges, and you’ll share what’s worked best for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>We keep the cohorts small, so you’ll have plenty of time to be coached on how you’ll implement your strategic UX Research.

                    <p>It’s frustrating to know that your organization could deliver better user experiences. Everything you’ve tried has failed to make the executive stakeholders understand how UX benefits your organization’s success.
                    </p>

                        <li>Drive organizational success by establishing outcome-driven objectives.

                    </h3>
                    <p><i>The roadmap is the pivotal place to show the value of Strategic UX Research.
                    </i></p>
                    <p>All significant strategic decisions originate in your organization’s product roadmap. The roadmap determines the direction of your products and services, which determines your organization's direction. As a UX leader, the roadmap is your opportunity to have the most influence over user experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your Strategic UX Research will shape significant product decisions when you anticipate what those decisions will be. The roadmap is your essential fortune-telling device, predicting the future of every team’s work. As a result, your entire organization becomes more knowledgeable about what your users need when you read the roadmap and discern what it subtly is telling you.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Move beyond starting each project from scratch and instead begin with an in-depth knowledge of what your users and customers need.
                        </li>
                        <li>Change your organization’s mindset from “we have to build a thing” to “we have to solve a customer’s problem.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Construct your long-term research agenda from the UX outcomes of each item currently on the roadmap.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add market-leading innovations to the roadmap that come directly from gaps you’ve uncovered in your users’ experiences.
                        </li>

                    <p><i>Spark a holistic shared understanding of your users' experiences.
                    </i></p>
                    <p>So much of today’s user research efforts are about squeezing what you learn into refining a close-to-done feature or capability. That changes with Strategic UX Research. Now, you’ll uncover the holistic experiences of your users and customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Continuous research shifts everyone away from the project-by-project piecemeal nature of conventional tactical approaches. Your new strategy will drive continuous learning, making everyone more knowledgeable as your team grows its comprehension of the problems and challenges your users and customers regularly face.
                    </p>

                        <li>Identify the inventive solutions customers will love you for.
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Become a trusted senior advisor that tackles the organization’s top priorities.

                    </i></p>
                    <p>Strategic UX Research is more than a skill or a tool to master. It’s a mindset that drives curiosity and shared understanding about your users, customers, and their needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>You’ll infuse your organization with that mindset (and the skills and tools to make it work) and drive dramatic change. That change will speed the delivery of better-designed products and services to your customers.

                        <li>Empower those in the organization who interact with users and customers to become better researchers.

                    <p><i>Connect your research directly to the organization’s highest priorities.
                    </i></p>
                    <p>You shouldn’t spend any more time explaining why research is essential. It’s time for action. Produce insightful results that demonstrate the rich value that Strategic UX Research brings.
                    </p>
                    <p>You need a direct mapping between your excellent research and your executives’ critical priorities. Get the attention of key stakeholders and executives. Supply them with irrefutable, compelling reasons to sponsor your work and champion your outcomes.

                    <ul>

                        <li>Match UX outcomes directly to the language executives use, making their achievement an organizational top priority.

                    <p>Every decision your executives make affects the experiences your organization delivers to your customers and users. When they make those decisions without research, they’re taking huge risks. Risks that often don’t pan out the way they’d like.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your Strategic UX Research can reduce those risks. As you build expertise about users and their needs throughout the organization, you’re making it easier to make informed decisions. Those decisions will prioritize improving your users' and customers' lives.

                    </i></p>
                    <p>For your executives to see your UX team, you must provide your executive team with UX metrics and goals. These UX metrics must show the team’s value and your contribution.
